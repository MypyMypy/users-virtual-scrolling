# Search Component

## Desciption

Here are the results of the following task:

- check and correct functionality (mock data is now displayed, search does not work). When entered into the search bar, there should be a request to the API to search for the user. To make a request to the api, use fetch api.
- implement search for users from a third-party resource https://dummyjson.com/users/search?q=John q is a search query
- cover with typing (will be a plus)
- think about application optimizations (would be a plus)
